# MapsetChecks
MapsetChecks is a plugin for MapsetVerifier which contains all default checks. By releasing the source of the plugin, users will be able to see behind the scenes and create their own custom checks by learning from how this library works. This also serves as a platform to notify me of issues with checks, like false-positives and false-negatives, if not through discord or elsewhere I might be.
