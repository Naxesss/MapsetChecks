                    By being unable to update a beatmap, potentially important fixes can easily be missed out on. This mostly 
                    affects players who download the map in qualified, as it is more visible to the public while not necessarily 
                    being in its final version.
                    <br><br>
                    The name of the file seems to determine how osu initially checks the map for updates. This is then presumably 
                    stored in some local database because deleting and re-downloading doesn't seem to affect it. So if you 
                    already had the map when the file name was correct, it may properly update for you while showing ""not 
                    submitted"" for others downloading it for the first time.
                    <br><br>
                    For Windows 10 users, file paths longer than 260 characters cannot properly be unzipped by the game and 
                    simply vanish instead. This varies between users based on where on their computer they put osu!, but
                    for the sake of consistency, we'll simply arbitrarily make 130 characters the limit.
