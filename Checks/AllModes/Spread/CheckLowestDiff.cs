                    Newer players usually struggle with especially long songs, so encouraging them to try shorter songs first at lower 
                    difficulty levels allows them to learn the basics before trying to train their stamina or similar. This is done by 
                    requiring that shorter songs have lower difficulties, while longer songs can have less of them. This also reduces the 
                    workload on mappers and as such introduces a larger variety of songs into the game that otherwise wouldn't be so common 
                    due to their length.
                    <note>
                        The star rating algorithm is currently only implemented for standard, so the suggested difficulty level of beatmaps 
                        not from standard is highly inaccurate. Changing the interpretation of difficulty levels manually will fix this.
