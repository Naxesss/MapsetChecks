                    A clickable object during the duration of an already clicked object, for example a slider, is possible to play 
                    assuming the clickable object is within the slider circle whenever a slider tick/edge happens. However, there is 
                    no way for a player to intuitively know how to play such patterns as there is no tutorial for them, and they are 
                    not self-explanatory.
                    <br \><br \>
                    Sliders, spinners, and other holdable objects, teach the player to hold down the key for 
                    the whole duration of the object, so suddenly forcing them to press again would be contradictory to that 
                    fundamental understanding. Because of this, these patterns more often than not cause confusion, even where 
                    otherwise introduced well.
